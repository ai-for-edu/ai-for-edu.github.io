                        Recent advanced AI technologies, especially the large language models (LLMs) like GPTs, have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) and led to the development of various LLM-based applications. One potential application is as communication interfaces in human-in-the-loop education systems, where the model serves as a mediator among the teacher, students and the machine capabilities including its own. This approach has several benefits, including the ability to personalize interactions, allow unprecedented flexibility and adaptivity for human-AI collaboration and improve the user experience. However, several challenges still exist in implementing this approach, including the need for more robust models, designing effective user interfaces, and ensuring ethical considerations are addressed.
<br>
                        This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to explore the cutting-edge AI technologies for personalized education, especially the potential of LLMs and adaptive learning technologies. The objectives of the workshop are to: 1. Review the current state-of-the-art in LLM-based systems and their applications in education. 2. Identify challenges and opportunities in using LLMs as both communication and collaboration interfaces in adaptive learning systems, educational games and intelligent educational assistant. 3. Discuss the potential of LLMs in improving human-computer interaction (HCI) and user experience in educational settings. 4. Discuss the state-of-the-art technologies of adaptive learning that tailor education to the individual needs, learning styles, proficiency levels, and problem areas of each student, for personalized learning experience. 5. Explore ethical considerations and standardization issues in the use of LLMs, especially with IEEE AI Standards Committee and IEEE Learning Technology Standards Committee. 6. Introduce and design new implementation approaches such as prompt engineering, local fine tuning, integrated reasoning, and delegation framework for dialog-based systems that use natural language to not only to generate content but also shape the behavior of the system. 

                        <br><br>This workshop encourages submissions of innovative solutions for a broad range of AI for Education problems. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following: </br>

                    We invite high-quality paper submissions of theoretical and experimental nature on the broad AI4EDU topics. The workshop solicits 5-7 pages double-blind paper submissions following CAI 2024 template from participants. All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Submissions of the following flavors will be sought: (1) research ideas, (2) case studies (or deployed projects), (3) review papers, (4) best practice papers, and (5) lessons learned. An optional appendix of arbitrary length is allowed and should be put at the end of the paper (after references).

                    <h3>Assessing learning in the era of AI</h3>
                    <p>
                        Abstract: Typical assessments of learning are through written assignments or through final written or oral examinations. The rise of AI, in particular generative AI, has changed the way people search for information and the way that people learn. Hence, the method of assessment should also reflect this change. In this talk, I will share potential areas that we can leverage AI to assess learning.
