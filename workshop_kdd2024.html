                        Recent advanced AI technologies, especially large language models (LLMs) like GPTs, have significantly advanced the field of data mining and led to the development of various LLM-based applications. AI for education (AI4EDU) is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of data mining, machine learning, and education, with increasing importance and extraordinary potential. In this field, LLM and adaptive learning-based models can be utilized as interfaces in human-in-the-loop education systems, where the model serves as a mediator among the teacher, students, and machine capabilities, including its own. This perspective has several benefits, including the ability to personalize interactions, allow unprecedented flexibility and adaptivity for human-AI collaboration, and improve the user experience. However, several challenges still exist, including the need for more robust and efficient algorithms, designing effective user interfaces, and ensuring ethical considerations are addressed.
<br>
                        This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to explore cutting-edge AI technologies for personalized education, especially the potential of LLMs and adaptive learning technologies. The objectives of the workshop are to: 1. Review the current state-of-the-art in LLM-based systems and their applications in education. 2. Discuss the state-of-the-art technologies of adaptive learning and mining that tailor education to the individual needs, learning styles, proficiency levels, and problem areas of each student, for personalized learning experience. 3. Identify challenges and opportunities in using LLMs as both communication and collaboration interfaces in adaptive learning systems, educational games and intelligent educational assistants. 4. Explore ethical considerations and standardization issues in the use of LLMs. 5. Introduce and design new approaches such as prompt engineering, local fine tuning, integrated reasoning, and delegation framework for dialog-based systems that not only generate content but also shape the behavior of the system.

                        <br><br>This workshop encourages submissions of innovative solutions for a broad range of AI for Education problems. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following: </br>
